# Purpose and usage

This XSLT is a proof of concept for the implementation of the specification concerning the DataCite profile of [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/63567/) (CiteDCAT-AP).
    
As such, this XSLT must be considered as unstable, and can be updated any time based on the revisions to the CiteDCAT-AP specifications.
